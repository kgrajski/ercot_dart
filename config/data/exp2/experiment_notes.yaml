description: |
  Classification-focused ERCOT dataset for DART price prediction.
  Creates binary classification targets from price differences for trading strategies.

key_achievements:
  - ✅ Clean classification dataset with binary targets
  - ✅ Enhanced temporal features (cyclical encoding, holidays)
  - ✅ Texas-specific holiday calendar
  - ✅ Progressive validation framework
  - ✅ XGBoost classification with cross-hour analysis
  - ✅ Professional visualization system

data_sources:
  primary:
    - processed_dam_spp_clean (settlement point prices)
    - processed_dam_system_lambda_clean (system lambda)
    - processed_load_forecast_clean (demand forecasts)
    - processed_wind_power_gen_clean (wind generation)
    - processed_solar_power_gen_clean (solar generation)
    - processed_rt_spp_transformed (real-time prices with statistics)

features:
  target: "dart_slt_class"  # Binary classification (price up/down)
  temporal: 
    - Cyclical encoding (hour, day, week, month, year)
    - Holiday features (Texas-specific calendar)
    - Lag features (24, 25, 26, 27, 168 hours)
    - Rolling statistics (7d, 14d, 21d windows)
  market:
    - Load forecast transformations
    - Wind/solar generation features
    - DART price historical patterns

workflow:
  dataset: "03-kag-exp2-ercot-study-dataset.py" 
  modeling: "04-kag-exp2-ercot-modeling.py"

key_learnings:
  - Classification approach works better for trading than regression
  - Progressive validation essential for time series
  - Hour-specific patterns vary significantly
  - Feature engineering critical for performance
